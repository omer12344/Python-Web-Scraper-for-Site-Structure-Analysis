Python Web Scraper for Site Structure Analysis
This Python project is a sophisticated web scraper designed to investigate and catalog the structure of websites. It uses the requests library to fetch web pages and BeautifulSoup from bs4 to parse and extract URLs, organizing the data into a comprehensive structure that represents the hierarchy and types of links found on the site.

Features:
Modular Design: Code is organized into separate modules for URL definitions (urls.py) and the main scraping logic (main.py), promoting readability and maintainability.
Object-Oriented Approach: Utilizes custom classes and enums to represent URLs and their types, facilitating easy manipulation and extension of the scraper's capabilities.
Dynamic User-Agent Rotation: Includes a list of user agents to simulate real-world browsing and avoid detection by simple anti-scraping mechanisms.
Efficient URL Filtering: Filters out irrelevant or redundant URLs based on predefined criteria, focusing the scraping effort on relevant pages.
Error Handling: Basic error handling is in place to manage common issues encountered during web scraping, such as network errors or unexpected content structures.
Performance Measurement: Decorators are used to measure and report the time taken for key operations, aiding in performance optimization and monitoring.

Usage:
This script is designed to be a starting point for more complex web scraping tasks. It can be customized to scrape specific sites, handle different types of content, and integrate with databases or other storage mechanisms.

Prerequisites:
Python 3.x
requests library
beautifulsoup4 library

Installation:
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Install the required Python packages using pip install -r requirements.txt (You'll need to create this file based on the dependencies mentioned above).
Customize the script parameters as needed for your specific scraping task.
