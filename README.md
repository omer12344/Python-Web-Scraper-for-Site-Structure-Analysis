# Python-Web-Scraper-for-Site-Structure-Analysis
This Python project is a sophisticated web scraper designed to investigate and catalog the structure of websites. It uses the requests library to fetch web pages and BeautifulSoup from bs4 to parse and extract URLs, organizing the data into a comprehensive structure that represents the hierarchy and types of links found on the site.
